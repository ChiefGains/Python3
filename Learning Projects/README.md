# Python3
Random scripts and programs in Python3


Scripts are written either for Windows or for Unix systems - usually for both

Scripts intended to work on Unix include shebang '#!user/bin/env Python3'. This ensures that unix systems will run the program using the python3 interpreter

Scripts and programs here are intended for fun and for learning, and have not the slightest inkling of commercial purpose to them
